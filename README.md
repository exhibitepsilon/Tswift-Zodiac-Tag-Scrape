# Tswift-Zodiac-Tag-Scrape

Tumblr's API won't let you get more than 50 notes -_-

To get Tags:
go to a post in the dashboard view (https://www.tumblr.com/blog/view/BLOG_NAME/POST_ID) and expand the notes. scroll to top to get all notes visible
copy html as text from the inspect element dashboard
process text
get post ids and blog names from the urls in the html
use official api to get tags
