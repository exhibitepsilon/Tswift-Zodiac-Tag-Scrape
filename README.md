# Tswift-Zodiac-Tag-Scrape

Tumblr's API won't let you get more than 50 notes -_-

To get Tags:

go to a post in the dashboard view (https://www.tumblr.com/blog/view/BLOG_NAME/POST_ID) and expand the notes. 

scroll to top of notes to get all notes visible

copy html as text from the inspect element dashboard

process text with stringr

get post ids and blog names from the urls in the html

use official api to get tags
